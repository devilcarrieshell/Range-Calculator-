# Range Calculator v 09.02.2023
this program does not display the exact value of the range. the purpose of creating is:
     the practice of compiling some formulas for calculations, 
     the practice of working with forms, 
     coding, 
     working on errors,
     and introducing some OOP principles into a simple program that works without these principles at the initial stage

#development opportunities:

Main porpose is to add OOP principe 19.02.2023
    
1. data management...
         
*add user input validation (For example, it may not make sense to allow a vehicle weight of 100,000 kg. 
I can add additional validation to the user input to ensure that it is within reasonable ranges.)
         
*Error handling (The program currently displays a message box when an input value is invalid, 
but it does not provide any information about the specific error. 
To improve the user experience, I can add more detailed error messages to help users correct their input.)

*Units (thr program uses metric units like a km, liters etc. I can add alternative units like a milles and galons)  
*also I can add an alternative types of fuel like a electric, hybrid, gas... and at the same purpose I can add diferit tipes of benzina

2. technical improvements ... 
         
* I CAN USE APIs like google APIs. It can improve the potrntial of my program and help to predict the best speed and route in different parts of trip 
(getting in consideration acceleration frequency, traffic jams, climbs and the rest of the vehicle and route parameters; it can predict a exact range, or something else)
the main problem is getting access at API keys, it can be unaffordable

*  to add saving data between sessions. To allow users to save their calculations, such as writing data to a file or database.

* additional calculations: currently the program only calculates the amount of fuel needed for one trip, but it may be useful to add support for additional calculations, such as estimating the cost of fuel for a given distance or determining the optimal fuel consumption rate for a given vehicle. According to porpouse of add an API additional calc. can be done automaticly
    
3. graphical user interface... 
 * The program currently uses a simple form-based interface, but it may be useful to add additional graphical elements such as a chart showing fuel consumption over time or a map showing the user's route.

to cut a long story short it is just some ideas
